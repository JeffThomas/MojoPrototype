Mojo
====

Mojo is a prototype of a scripting language I was working on called Mojo. The main file for this index.html which opens a text field you can type a Mojo program into and try to execute it.

It was written in JavaScript so I could work on it using an iPad and TexTastic while commuting to SF and back on BART. I hate pulling out a laptop on BART.

Mojo reached the end of it's usefulness several years ago when I took what I learned from it and started working on Juno.
