Mojo
====

Mojo is a prototype of a scripting language I was working on called Mojo. The main file for this index.html which opens a text field you can type a Mojo program into and try to execute it.

Mojo reached the end of it's usefulness several years ago when I took what I learned from it and started working on Juno.
